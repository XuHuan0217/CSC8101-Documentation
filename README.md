Data Analytics coursework.

Course details and additional information are available 
[here](https://sites.google.com/site/paolomissier/home/for-students/csc8101-big-data-analytics).

## Requesting Help

There are various practical sessions across the course where you can ask for
help from the demonstrators. This is primary way to get help on the coursework
so please take advantage of these sessions.

If you need help outside of the practicals then you can use the 
[issues section](https://github.com/tomncooper/CSC8101-Documentation/issues) of 
this documentation repository to post questions. This will allow you to see if the 
question has been asked and answered already. Frequently asked questions will be 
added to the relevant courseworks's FAQ.
